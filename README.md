feat_templates

The feat templates (design.fsf files) for L3 only show a single contast
per task per type of analysis (ie Activation or PPI). Additional contrasts
were analyzed by replacing a COPE and pointing it to another COPE (for 
example, a COPE1 for the social task, Ment-Rand, would be replaced with 
COPE 2 on the second iteration of analyses).
